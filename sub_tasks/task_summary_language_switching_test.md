# language_switching_test

I have successfully tested the language switching functionality on the website. I navigated to the settings page, switched the language from Azerbaijani to English and back, and verified the changes with screenshots. I also confirmed that the language change persists across different pages by navigating to the dashboard. The functionality works as expected. I have attached the screenshots as evidence.
