# Quiz_Creation_Page_Test

The Quiz Creation page at https://9co9g0gt8ouk.space.minimax.io/create-quiz is currently inaccessible due to a critical JavaScript error. Upon navigating to the page after logging in, an error is thrown related to a `<Select.Item />` component having an empty `value` prop. This prevents the page from rendering, displaying an error message instead. The test involved navigating to the page, creating a test account, logging in, and attempting to access the quiz creation functionality. The error was consistently reproducible and is documented with a screenshot and console logs.
