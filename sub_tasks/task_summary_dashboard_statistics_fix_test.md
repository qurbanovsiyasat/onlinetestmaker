## Dashboard Statistics Fix Test

**Objective:** To test the fix for the dashboard statistics loading issue.

**Methodology:**

1.  Navigated to the provided URL and logged in with the given credentials.
2.  Verified that the dashboard loaded without any errors.
3.  Inspected the browser console for any HTTP 400 errors related to `quiz_results`.
4.  Completed a quiz to test the quiz workflow and to see if the statistics would update.
5.  Returned to the dashboard to check the statistics cards and console logs again.

**Findings:**

*   **SUCCESS:** The original bug has been fixed. The dashboard no longer shows the "Statistics data could not be loaded" error, and there are no more HTTP 400 errors in the console.
*   **NEW BUG:** The statistics on the dashboard are not updating after a quiz is completed. The cards continue to show "0" for all metrics even after a quiz has been taken.

**Conclusion:** The initial bug has been resolved, but a new issue has been identified where the dashboard statistics are not updating after user activity. The quiz completion workflow itself is not broken.

**Supporting Evidence:**

*   `dashboard_screenshot.png`: Shows the dashboard loading correctly with "0" values in the statistics cards.
*   `dashboard_after_quiz.png`: Shows the dashboard after completing a quiz, with the statistics cards still at "0".
*   `quiz_results.png`: Shows the results of the completed quiz.
