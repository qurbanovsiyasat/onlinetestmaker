# Squiz_Platform_Test

## Squiz Platform Test Summary

**Execution Process:**

1.  **Login & Dashboard:** Successfully logged in with the provided credentials. The dashboard loaded, but a critical error message, "Statistics data could not be loaded," was displayed. Other sections of the dashboard, like "Popular Quizzes" and "Recent Activity," appeared to have some data, but the core statistical component is broken. The UI's accent color is purple/indigo, not the specified blue (#4361EE), indicating a design inconsistency.
2.  **Quiz System:**
    *   **Quiz Creation:** Navigating to the "Create Quiz" page resulted in a "Something went wrong" error, making it impossible to create new quizzes.
    *   **Existing Quiz:** Attempting to start an existing quiz also led to a "Something went wrong" error. The entire quiz system is non-functional.
3.  **Settings Page:** The Settings page failed to load, displaying the same "Something went wrong" error.
4.  **Q&A Page:** This page also failed to load, presenting the same error message.
5.  **Forms Page:** The Forms page was also inaccessible due to the recurring "Something went wrong" error.
6.  **Profile Page:** The Profile page failed to load, displaying the same error.
7.  **Console Analysis:** The browser console is filled with `supabase.api.non200` errors (HTTP 400), indicating that multiple backend API calls are failing. This is the likely root cause of the widespread "Something went wrong" errors.

**Key Findings & Core Conclusions:**

The Squiz platform is in a **critically broken state**. The majority of its core features are inaccessible due to a persistent backend issue, as evidenced by the repeated API errors. The application is unusable for its primary purpose of creating, taking, and managing quizzes.

*   **Critical Failure:** The backend API is consistently returning errors, preventing most pages from loading any meaningful content.
*   **UI Inconsistency:** The implemented accent color does not match the specified new design.
*   **Recommendation:** The immediate priority is to investigate and fix the backend API errors. Without a functioning API, no further meaningful testing or use of the platform is possible.

**Final Deliverables:**

*   This summary report.
*   Screenshots documenting the various errors encountered:
