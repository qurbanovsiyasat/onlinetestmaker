# Test Plan for Bug Fixes

## Test Cases

### 1. Form Access Issues ✅
**Issue**: Forms showing "Form not found" after creation
**Fix Applied**: Improved error handling logic in FormDetailPage.tsx
- Changed error condition to only show "Form not found" when there's an actual error (not during loading)
- Separated loading state from error state
- Only show "not found" after loading is complete and no form exists

**Testing Steps**:
1. Create a new form
2. Navigate to the form detail page
3. Verify form loads correctly without "Form not found" error
4. Test both public and private forms

### 2. Q&A Page Access Issues ✅
**Issue**: Q&A page errors when accessing
**Fix Applied**: Improved admin context handling in QAQuestionPage.tsx
- Fixed admin context access with proper null checking
- Used explicit assignment instead of destructuring

**Testing Steps**:
1. Navigate to Q&A section
2. Click on any question
3. Verify page loads without errors
4. Test both as regular user and admin

### 3. Quiz Result Rankings - First Attempt Only ✅
**Issue**: Rankings not showing properly and not limited to first attempts
**Fix Applied**: 
- Created new RPC function `get_quiz_first_attempts_leaderboard`
- Modified useQuizLeaderboard hook to use first attempts only
- Added fallback logic for backward compatibility

**Testing Steps**:
1. Take a quiz multiple times with same user
2. Check leaderboard shows only first attempt score
3. Verify all users appear in rankings
4. Confirm ranking order is correct (score desc, time asc)

### 4. Quiz Success Animation - Confetti for 70%+ Scores ✅
**Issue**: Missing confetti animation for scores above 70%
**Fix Applied**:
- Added canvas-confetti library
- Implemented confetti in QuizTakePage on quiz completion for scores ≥70%
- Added confetti in QuizResultPage when viewing results with scores ≥70%
- Multiple confetti bursts for celebration effect

**Testing Steps**:
1. Take a quiz and score above 70%
2. Verify confetti animation appears on completion
3. Navigate to results page and verify confetti appears again
4. Test with score below 70% to confirm no confetti
