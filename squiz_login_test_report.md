# Squiz Application Login & Localization Test Report

## Test Overview
- **URL**: https://ty03hh9mey8m.space.minimax.io
- **Test Date**: 2025-08-20
- **Credentials Used**: fahzvdtr@minimax.com / Xob70A2vjm
- **Primary Objectives**: 
  1. Test login functionality with provided credentials
  2. Check for authentication errors in console
  3. Verify localization by examining "All categories" text

## Test Results Summary

### ❌ Login Functionality - BLOCKED
**Status**: FAILED - Critical form bug prevents testing

**Issue Identified**: 
The login form exhibits a severe synchronization bug where input fields mirror each other's values regardless of which field receives focus. This prevents proper credential entry:

- When email is entered in email field → both fields contain email
- When password is entered in password field → both fields contain password
- Fields cannot maintain separate values simultaneously

**Evidence**:
- Screenshot: `login_form_synchronization_bug.png`
- Multiple input attempts using different methods (batch input, individual input, keyboard navigation)
- All attempts resulted in field value synchronization

**Console Status**: No JavaScript errors or authentication errors detected in console logs

### ❌ Localization Testing - NOT COMPLETED
**Status**: INCOMPLETE - Blocked by login failure

**Observations**:
- Landing page displays Azerbaijani localization:
  - "Giriş" (Login)
  - "Qeydiyyat" (Registration) 
  - "Squiz ilə Öyrənməyə Yeni Baxış" (A New Look at Learning with Squiz)
- Could not access authenticated sections to test "All categories" text
- Unable to verify localization consistency across different application sections

## Technical Analysis

### Form Behavior Analysis
1. **Input Field Synchronization Bug**: 
   - Email field (element [3]) and Password field (element [4]) share synchronized values
   - Client-side JavaScript likely causing unintended field binding
   - No server-side validation reached due to client-side failure

2. **Browser Compatibility**: 
   - Issue persists across different input methods
   - Form validation correctly identifies missing '@' when password appears in email field
   - Suggests client-side validation working, but input handling broken

### Authentication Status
- **Console Logs**: Clean - no JavaScript errors, API failures, or authentication errors
- **Network Requests**: No authentication requests sent due to form validation failure
- **Session Status**: Unauthenticated - unable to progress past login form

## Localization Findings (Limited)

### Confirmed Azerbaijani Text Elements:
- Navigation: "Giriş" (Login), "Qeydiyyat" (Register)
- Form Labels: "Email və şifrənizi daxil edin" (Enter your email and password)
- Placeholders: "Şifrənizi daxil edin" (Enter your password)
- Actions: "Giriş et" (Log in), "İndi Başlayın" (Start Now)
- Registration prompt: "Hesabınız yoxdur? Qeydiyyatdan keçin" (Don't have an account? Register)

### Character Set Support:
- Proper rendering of Azerbaijani special characters: ə, ı, ş, ö
- No encoding issues observed in visible text

## Recommendations

### Critical Priority
1. **Fix Form Input Synchronization**: Investigate and resolve the JavaScript code causing input field mirroring
2. **Form Testing**: Implement proper input field isolation testing in development environment
3. **Authentication Flow**: Cannot proceed with authentication testing until form bug is resolved

### Future Testing Requirements
Once form bug is fixed, re-test with focus on:
1. Complete login flow with provided credentials
2. Authentication error handling
3. Post-login navigation and "All categories" localization
4. Cross-section localization consistency

## Conclusion

The Squiz application login functionality is currently blocked by a critical form input synchronization bug. While the application shows proper Azerbaijani localization on public pages and console logs are clean, the inability to log in prevents comprehensive testing of authenticated features and localization consistency.

**Immediate Action Required**: Development team should address the form input synchronization issue before further authentication and localization testing can be completed.
